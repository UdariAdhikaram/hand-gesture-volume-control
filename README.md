# hand-gesture-volume-control
Develop a complete project fro Hand Gesture Volume Control in Python programming and OpenCV library

In this Hand Gesture Volume Control project install and import opencv, pyautogui and mediapipe libraries using pycharm.Then, to capture the web camera and show the video using imshow function using opencv python. Then, to capture hands using mediapipe library and showing hand landmarks in the video.

After going to identify the thumb finger and fore finger land marks and draw lines between them and after that going to learn HOW TO CALCULATE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN TWO POINTS USING PYTHON and increase or decrease the volume of the computer using pyautoguiÂ library.

Technologies Used:

Python: The core programming language for the project.
OpenCV: For capturing video from the webcam and displaying it.
mediapipe: To detect and track hand landmarks.
pyautogui: To adjust the system volume based on the distance between the thumb and forefinger.

Acknowledgements:

OpenCV: For providing robust computer vision capabilities.
mediapipe: For its powerful hand tracking and landmark detection.
pyautogui: For allowing seamless control over system functions.
